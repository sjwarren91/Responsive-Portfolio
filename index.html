                    Hi all, my name is Sam. I am currently working as an Electrical Engineer in
                    the Digital Grid division of Siemens Australia. I graduated from Griffith University on the Gold
                    Coast and moved to Melbourne February of 2018. </p>

                <p class="p1">
                    I am currently in a sales position and do not particularly enjoy it, I never saw
                    myself as a salesman and it is definitely not where I saw my career heading as an Engineer.
                    I always enjoyed my coding subjects at Uni, and I have gained an interest in the development of web
                    applications
                    specifically suited for the emerging IoT area of energy distribution. I believe this course will
                    give me
                    the necessary skills to follow this area of interest.</p>

                <p class="p1">
                    In my spare time I like to go to the gym, play video games, read and also write. I am working on a
                    novel
                    that will be put on hold until I finish this course. I have a fat ginger cat called Fatty who is
                    pictured to the left. I love to travel, especially to places where
                    there is snow.
                    I have been to Japan 3 times now to snowboard and each trip has been better than the last. I try and
                    snowboard any chance
                    I get. I will be going to Austria at the end of this year to snowboard the Alps which I am super
                    keen for.
